<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I’m Evelyne Kroval—Evie for short. I’m a burgeoning developer with a growing focus on AI and product thinking, shaped by hands-on experience in technical operations and system design. My background spans insurance, stakeholder collaboration, and internal innovation initiatives, where I’ve carved out a space at the intersection of people, process, and intelligent tooling. I’m especially interested in how AI can be meaningfully grounded in real-world use cases—designed with clarity, empathy, and rigour.</p>

<p>Most recently, I’ve acted as the Product Owner for an internal AI project, guiding it from concept to MVP. Alongside that, I’ve worked as a Super User and systems lead, translating business needs into actionable change. While I’m newer to development in the formal sense, I bring a strong analytical mindset, natural fluency in structured thinking, and a deep appreciation for what makes tools genuinely useful. I’m learning fast—and intentionally—by combining on-the-ground experimentation with strategic growth.</p>

<p>Beyond work, I keep myself rooted through poetry, music, running, and the occasional rave. These give me space to stay present, recharge, and reflect—which makes me better at the rest. This site is a working record of my evolution: from technical team lead to AI-focused developer. Thanks for being part of the journey.
